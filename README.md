Machine Learning based Scheduler Predictor that uses Random Forest to predict the optimal scheduling algorithm based on process characteristics such as:
•	Arrival time
•	Burst time
•	Priority
•	Historical performance metrics

The system also features a GUI built using Tkinter, allowing users to input process details and visualize the predicted scheduling algorithm as ganntt chart along with performance metrics.
