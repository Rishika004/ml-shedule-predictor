Machine Learning based Scheduler Predictor that uses Random Forest to predict the optimal scheduling algorithm based on process characteristics such as:
•	Arrival time
•	Burst time
•	Priority
•	Historical performance metrics

Accuracy:92.6%
Precision	0.91
Recall	0.93
F1-Score	0.92
The system also features a GUI built using Tkinter, allowing users to input process details and visualize the predicted scheduling algorithm as ganntt chart along with performance metrics.
Please run the gui file to run the project
